- Training of neuron with various activation functions.
- 3A. A college professor believes that if the grade for internal examination is high in a class,
the grade for external examination will also be high. A random sample of 7 students in that
class was selected, and the data is given below:
 Input 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7
 Target 1.2 1.4 1.55 1.75 2.01 2.2 2.35
- Write a python program for linear regression using a single neuron (with proper activation
function) on the above dataset, and find the coefficients w1,and b.
- Predict the external marks if internal marks are 0.15.
- Draw the scatter plot between Internal Exam and External Exam .Draw a straight line with
red line using above w1, w2 and b.
- 3B. Generate 51 points for = 1 1 + exp⁡(−3x),where x ∈ [−2, 3].Use this dataset to train
sigmoid neuron using gradient descent learning algorithm. Draw two curves with different
colours, for target and output(y) of the trained neuron.
